## The Philosophy Behind Chiron

Chiron was the wise centaur who mentored heroes like Achilles and Jason. He transformed raw potential into mastery through clear, patient guidance.

Chiron was considered to be the best centaur amongst all, he was called the "wisest and justest of all the centaurs" whose skills were said to almost match those of his foster father Apollo.

Like the mythological mentor, Chiron transforms complex technical information into clear, accessible knowledge. Every design choice serves one purpose: making knowledge accessible to everyone because knowledge should be accessible, and learning should feel effortless.
