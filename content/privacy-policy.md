# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: January 2025

## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how Chiron ("we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use our documentation template.

## Information We Collect

Chiron is a static site generator that creates documentation websites. The generated sites are static HTML files that do not collect or transmit personal information by default.

### Generated Websites

Websites generated by Chiron:

- **Do not collect personal data** by default
- **Do not use tracking scripts** unless you explicitly add them
- **Do not store cookies** unless you enable cookie consent features
- Are **fully under your control** - you decide what to include

### Optional Features

If you enable certain features in your configuration:

- **Cookie Consent Banner**: Allows users to manage cookie preferences
- **Analytics Integration**: Only if you manually add analytics scripts
- **External Links**: May navigate users to third-party sites with their own privacy policies

## Data Storage

Chiron itself:

- Runs locally on your machine
- Does not send data to external servers
- Does not collect usage statistics
- Does not require registration or authentication

## Third-Party Services

The default Chiron template may include:

### Google Fonts

- Used for typography
- Subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- Can be replaced with self-hosted fonts

### CDN Resources

- Prism.js for syntax highlighting (via CDN)
- Can be replaced with self-hosted versions

## Your Responsibilities

When using Chiron to create documentation sites, you are responsible for:

1. **Compliance**: Ensuring your site complies with applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
2. **Disclosure**: Informing users about any data collection or cookies
3. **Consent**: Obtaining necessary consents for cookies or tracking
4. **Third-party Services**: Understanding privacy implications of any services you integrate

## Cookies

The default Chiron template includes:

- **Essential Cookies**: For theme preference (dark/light mode)
- **Cookie Consent**: Optional banner to manage user preferences

You can disable all cookies by setting `features.cookie_consent: false` in your configuration.

## Children's Privacy

Chiron is a developer tool and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in the repository with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding personal data, including:

- Right to access
- Right to correction
- Right to deletion
- Right to data portability
- Right to object to processing

Since Chiron-generated sites are static and don't collect data by default, these rights primarily apply to any additional services you integrate.

## GDPR Compliance

If you're creating sites for EU users:

1. Add a privacy policy to your site
2. Implement cookie consent if using cookies
3. Ensure any third-party services are GDPR-compliant
4. Provide mechanisms for users to exercise their rights

## California Privacy Rights

California residents have specific rights under CCPA. Since Chiron doesn't collect personal information, these primarily apply to any additional services you integrate.

## Security

Chiron-generated sites are static HTML files, which provides inherent security benefits:

- No server-side processing
- No database vulnerabilities
- No user authentication to compromise
- Reduced attack surface

However, ensure:

- Your hosting provider is secure
- HTTPS is enabled
- Dependencies are kept updated

## Data Retention

Chiron does not retain any data. Generated sites are static files under your control.

## International Transfers

Chiron is open-source software that can be used anywhere. Generated sites can be hosted in any jurisdiction you choose.

## Disclaimer

This privacy policy applies to Chiron as a tool. Websites you create with Chiron are your responsibility, and you should create appropriate privacy policies for them based on your specific use case and applicable laws.
